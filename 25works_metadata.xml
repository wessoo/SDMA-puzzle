			<title>Portrait of Mrs. Robert Henri</title>
			<date>August 1914</date>
			<size>24 in. x 20 in. (60.9 cm x 50.8 cm)</size>
			<credit>Gift of Mrs. George Heyneman</credit>
			<description>Robert Henri studied at both the Académie Julian and the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Though Thomas Eakins was no longer teaching at the Academy when Henri arrived, Eakins was immensely influential for Henri, who regarded him as the superior portrait painter in the United States and followed Eakins’s bluntly realist style.

			This painting of Robert Henri’s second wife, Marjorie Organ Henri, was given by the artist to Alice Klauber, who studied with Henri in Spain in 1907. Klauber invited Henri to San Diego in 1914, and he assisted her with the organization of an exhibition of American painting for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition, which was held in what became Balboa Park. The exhibition brought the work of George Bellows, William Glackens, Childe Hassam, John Sloan, and Henri to San Diego.</description>

			<description>Zuijin are Shinto protector deities modeled after two of the most powerful positions within the Japanese court during the Heian period (794–1185). They are dressed as captains of the imperial bodyguard, in courtier's attire of the highest rank. The younger Minister of the Left is depicted with his mouth closed, and his elder counterpart is shown with his mouth slightly open.  Zuijin are perceived as Shinto equivalents of Buddhist guardian deities, for both share the same closed and open mouth pairing, and both flank the entrances to a place of worship.</description>

			<credit>Gift of Mr. Archer M. Huntington in memory of his mother, Arabella D. Huntington</credit>
			<description>Sorolla was the most internationally famous Spanish artist of his day. Early in his career, he was greatly influenced by the realism of Velázquez and other artists of the 17th-century Spanish Golden Age, but he spent much time in Paris in the years around 1900 and developed a particular talent for combining traditional Spanish painting with the new approaches of French Impressionism and Post-Impressionism.

			Sorolla painted plein air portraits with great skill and success, starting with his family and later portraying even the king and queen of Spain. This portrait is of the artist’s daughter at age 17, when she had recently recovered from tuberculosis. She is shaded by trees that are not shown in the painting, but the juxtaposition of cool shadows with glowing patches of light is one of the artist’s trademarks, as is the deft manipulation of paint into thick impasto highlights.</description>

			<description>Trained at the Royal Academy in Paris, Bouguereau became one of the most prolific and successful exhibitors at the Parisian Salon in the later 19th century. Like Realist painters including Courbet or Millet, he shared a passion for subjects drawn from rural life. Bouguereau’s rural figures, however, are always closer to the idealized shepherds and shepherdesses of classical pastoral poetry than to the earthy farmers more often depicted by the Realists.

			Moreover, during the decades when the Realists and Impressionists developed their bold anti-academic styles, Bouguereau remained the principal proponent of traditional painting, and his works are characterized by the superbly drawn anatomy and high degree of finish seen here.</description>

			<credit>Gift of Anne R. and Amy Putnam</credit>
			<description>One of El Greco’s most enduring devotional images, The Penitent Saint Peter was a subject to which the painter often returned, and this is one of at least six known versions of the composition. The painting depicts the repentant Saint Peter, distraught at having denied that he knew Christ when questioned on the eve of the crucifixion.

			The saint is dramatically isolated, set against the dark trunk of a tree and lit by an ethereal light that emphasizes his soulful expression and posture. The scene in the background at left shows Mary Magdalene returning from Christ’s tomb: having received the news of Christ’s resurrection from an angel, she runs to tell Saint Peter.

			This work is marked by a religious intensity that can be related to the concerns of the Counter-Reformation church. The biblical description of Saint Peter’s penitence in the days after the crucifixion was used by Counter-Reformation Catholics to justify the sacrament of penance or confession, which had been challenged by Protestantism. Devotional concerns aside, the canvas is a quintessential example of El Greco’s painterly virtuosity and of the poignant humanity of his figures.

			<description>Buddhist sculptures from southwestern China, like this example in the Museum’s collection, are exceptionally rare, especially when datable by inscription. The graceful standing figure can be identified as Guanyin, the bodhisattva of compassion, because of the figure of the Buddha Amitabha in the crown.

			The character “Da” has been carved on each foot, which indicates that it was made for the royal family of the Dali Kingdom. The extensive inscription on the back of the garment reveals that the Emperor Duan Zhengxing paid for this sculpture to be made for his sons, to ensure their prosperity and the continuation of the family line. It is interesting to note that no esoteric or philosophical ideas of Buddhism were invoked by these patrons.</description>

			<credit>Anonymous gift</credit>
			<description>An avid collector, Tamayo acquired art that today forms the core of two museums in Mexico: one in Oaxaca that displays pre-Columbian art and another in Mexico City that presents modern and contemporary art. These interests are found in his own works, which incorporate traditional Mexican imagery, yet are infused with the spirit of contemporary Surrealism.

			Tamayo created both easel paintings and large-scale murals. He was a contemporary of the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros, but he explored abstraction to an extent not attempted by these others. The Somnambulist reveals Tamayo’s interest in developing a highly original style in its rendering of a sleepwalker with angular Cubist shapes and bold hues of orange and blue.</description>

			<credit>Valerie Franklin Collection</credit>
			<description>Skull racks were the most valued ritual objects created in the Gulf of Papua which is located on the southern coast of the island of New Guinea, just north of Australia. These racks depict imunu spirits which are associated with features of the natural landscape and surrounding waters. To maintain prosperity in the community, families owning land containing imunu would create sculptures, including skull racks, to honor individual spirits. 

			Placed on the walls of collective family shrines, these sculptures were designed to suspend skulls from the prongs framing the figure’s torso using loops of rattan. Skulls served to empower the honored spirit while functioning as a tangible symbol of the family’s strength and vitality. While it is unknown how many skulls this rack held, some contained dozens of skulls which would have been placed on a supplemental shelf below the rack for additional support. The art of the Papuan Gulf hovers between painting and sculpture, with low relief calligraphic lines flowing in bordered spaces. Figures from the Papuan Gulf tend to have circular eyes, upturned mouths and prominent navels that refer to birth and spiritual rebirth.</description>

			<credit>Gift of Anne R. and Amy Putnam</credit>
			<description>The principal masterpiece of The San Diego Museum of Art's collection of Italian paintings, Giorgione’s Portrait of a Man (often identified as the Terris Portrait after the name of a former owner) is indeed one of the greatest Renaissance portraits in the United States.

			The work epitomizes what Vasari called the modern manner, in which Giorgione sought to paint living and natural things. In a notable contrast to the sculptural surfaces common in fifteenth-century painting, Giorgione’s brushstrokes lack precise detail but surpass those of all earlier painters in their ability to describe warm flesh and soft hair.

			The composition is closely cropped around the head of the sitter, and the setting or props often used to animate portrait paintings are absent, but the man’s turning gaze and ambiguous expression nonetheless make the work wholly engaging and alive. His somber demeanor seems to be emphasized by the dark tonality of the work, but technical examination has revealed that his now-black jacket was painted with blue and red pigments that have darkened with time: this serious man was originally seen in a flamboyant purple garment.</description>

			<description>Matisse came to painting later in life than his precocious rival, Picasso, and was introduced to Impressionism by the languorous later works of Pierre Renoir. The jarring juxtaposition of colors that distinguished Matisse’s paintings beginning in 1900 led to his being branded a Fauve (wild beast), a label that came to describe an artistic movement. Matisse retreated to a more restricted palette around 1910, but in this large still life, executed after the outbreak of World War I, we witness a return to the bold decorative sensibility and high-keyed color that would henceforth characterize Matisse’s modern vision. Matisse likened the best painting to a good armchair, which provides relaxation from physical fatigue. This resolutely bourgeois conception of art’s function is well served by this elegantly informal subject: an arrangement of flowers—probably gathered in the artist’s garden in the suburbs of Paris—positioned against a loosely brushed grey ground.</description>

			<description>This important stone sculpture is the earliest known representation of Shiva as Lord of Music.  It once formed part of a sculptural group on the south exterior wall of a Hindu temple and was probably associated with a group of mother goddesses.  

			Shiva's four arms indicate his superhuman power, and the plain halo encircling his head underscores his divinity.  With his lower two arms he plays a vina, a traditional Indian stringed instrument, the lower section of which has broken away. This aspect of Shiva is benevolent; he is bejeweled and smiles gently as he plays his divine music. Nevertheless, he still holds his trident, grasps a cobra in his upper left hand, and his hair is arranged in matted dreadlocks. Thus, Shiva embodies the contradictory personalities of peaceful musician, fearsome warrior, and ascetic (yogi) who transcends the bounds of societal norms.</description>

			<size></size>
			<credit>Gift of Mr. and Mrs. John Jeffers</credit>
			<description>This important painting made at the Ming dynasty court is an example of the refined, colorful imperial style. The subject is the ordination of Empress Zhang (1470–1541) as a high priestess of the Daoist religion. She was the sole consort of the Emperor Hongshi (r. 1488–1505) and mother of his successor.

			The scroll unfolds with alternating sections of calligraphy and figural painting related to the ordination ceremony. The figures include depictions of the highest Daoist gods and a portrait of the Empress. Daoist officials and protectors follow against stylized, pastel swirling clouds. The middle section has a long black ink inscription written by the ordination master. It outlines the important scriptures, talismans and lists of gods’ names that were transmitted to the empress. Eight large characters written in gold seal script and nineteen more individually portrayed gods, some “Celestial Guards,” complete this stunning scroll. </description>

			<size>83 3/8 in. x 48 1/8 in. (211.8 cm x 122.2 cm)</size>
			<credit>Gift of Mrs. Thomas Eakins</credit>
			<description>After studying and painting in France and Spain, Thomas Eakins brought back to the United States what he learned in Europe and applied it to the life he knew in Philadelphia. He was an influential instructor at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and even after his removal from the Academy, students continued to follow his innovative ideas and were enthusiastic about his encouragement to find inspiration in the people and places of the United States. Steadfast in his realism, Eakins was a controversial figure in his day but is today regarded among the most important of American artists.

			This life-sized portrait is typical of Eakins’s later works in which the subject emerges dramatically from a dark background. The portrait depicts James Carroll Beckwith, an American painter known mainly for his portraits and romanticized female figures. Eakins depicts Beckwith in the act of painting one such work, a portrait of Mrs. Beckwith, who was also an artist.</description>

			<size>18 in. x 22 in. (45.7 cm x 55.9 cm)</size>
			<credit>Bequest of Mrs. E. Clarence Moore</credit>
			<description>In this non-traditional portrait, Diego Rivera chose to focus on the doctor’s hands instead of creating a more typical image that featured the sitter’s face. The inscription reads, “These are the hands of Dr. Clarence Moore of Los Angeles, California. They trim the tree of life so that it is renewed and does not die. Diego Rivera painted them in 1940.”

			With its reference to roots, female anatomy, and blood, and through the use of a ribbon-like banner that includes an inscription, the painting recalls the work of Frida Kahlo, a Mexican artist whom Rivera twice married.

			The anthropomorphic tree that is transformed from a symbol of the natural world to the female figure reflects the status of the tree as an iconic symbol in Mexican art history from pre-Columbian to contemporary times. Moreover the tree motif appears in the Museum’s other painting by Rivera, the Mandrágora of 1939, and in such works as Pan American Unity, also created in 1940, and permanently on view at San Francisco City College.</description>

			<credit>Bequest of Emile Leonard Schoppe</credit>
			<description>The Meiping, for holding flowers, is a distinctive tall vase form with small, contracted neck and mouth and a high, widely swelling shoulder tapering with a gentle concave curve to a flat circular bottom. It is stately and sophisticated with simple yet elegant expanding and contracting contours. This choice, pristine vessel with its sense of natural purity and deep, soft white surface is covered with very subtle, barely distinguishable, incised peony scrolls and bands of floral and vine motifs that do not interrupt the perfection of the vessel’s contours.

			Jingdezhen ware made during the flourishing Yongle period of the Qing dynasty refers to a superior, high-fired porcelain. Its distinguishing features include thin walls and a translucent milky-white glaze that was much admired and emulated. Jingdezhen ware inspired the producers of ceramics in Korea, whose fifteenth-century examples rival those of China.</description>

			<description>The outdoor May S. Marcy Sculpture Court, adjacent the Museum’s main building, is a must-see for monumental art.  Under cover of the Sculpture Court Café stands Louise Nevelson’s Night Presence II of 1976, an arresting meditation on architecture composed of columns, finials and scroll-sawed steel offcuts.

			Experimenting first with wall-mounted assemblages of found objects, mostly wood, which the artist painted either all black or all white to unify her three-dimensional compositions, Nevelson began in the 1960s to translate these reliefs into freestanding sculptures.  The use of welded Cor-Ten steel, its oxidized patina a rusty red, allowed Nevelson to install her work outdoors, her boxy abstractions recalling oversized Cubist collages.

			In contrast to Night Presence II’s forest of standing forms, the sculpture court also showcases Henry Moore’s Reclining Figure: Arch Leg of 1969, alongside works by such sculptors as Barbara Hepworth and David Smith.</description>

			<description>Frank Stella first came into prominence in 1959, when his spare, black-and-white canvases were featured in a seminal show at the Museum of Modern Art, and he emerged in the 1960s as one of the leading figures of American Abstraction. 

			In marked contrast to the paradigm of painting as a magic window, Stella advanced a more literal, concrete conception of the painted surface as a pattern bounded by edges. His shaped canvases of concentric black-and-white bands set the stage for the Minimalist movement, but Stella began in the later 1960s to integrate color into his increasingly monumental compositions. One of a series of paintings that explored relationships of color, form and pattern, Flin Flon VIII’s petal-like geometric shapes– made of overlapping protractor outlines– seem to project and recede in a dizzying optical dance.</description>

			<description>Dix served as a machine gunner in the German army in World War I and knew at first hand war’s ability to dehumanize humanity: to turn men into beasts. Nowhere is that idea clearer than in this painting, which shows one of Dix’s fellow artillerymen, the Cannoneer Löwe. Playing on the man’s name—Löwe means “lion” in German—Dix has transformed his companion, giving him the fierce feline features of his namesake. The man emerges from a hot orange glow, and both the rough brushstrokes and the unpainted margins of the board are surely meant to give the impression that this was the man as glimpsed in the heat of a battle. The painting is part of a significant group of German Expressionist works at the Museum of Art. </description>

			<description>After receiving his initial artistic education in San Diego under Maurice Braun, Alfred Mitchell studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and traveled in Europe before returning to California. He would later serve as President of the San Diego Art Guild and was among those who signed the incorporation papers for the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego, which today is known as The San Diego Museum of Art.

			Like many of his contemporary artists in Southern California, Mitchell combined in his work the lessons both of Thomas Eakins’s American Realism and of French art; the resulting plein air style has come to be known as California Impressionism. Visitors to The San Diego Museum of Art will find on display a group of California Impressionist paintings that includes Mitchell’s work alongside that of such artists as Maurice Braun, Nicolai Fechin, Charles Fries, Charles Reiffel, Guy Rose, and Elliott Torrey.</description>

			<description>After studying at the Art Institute of Chicago, Georgia O’Keeffe spent time intermittently in New York City, where she met the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, who promoted her art. Though she created images of the urban environment in the 1920s, after 1929 O’Keeffe lived in New Mexico during the summer, and in 1946 she moved there permanently.

			Much of her extensive artistic productions became focused on diverse elements of the natural world: animal bones, shells, desert, sky, and most frequently, flowers. She often enlarged flowers, making a single flower dominate the entire pictorial space. With The White Flower,O’Keeffe explores the beauty of nature and emphasizes formal qualities such as shape, color, and line.

			The San Diego Museum of Art possesses three other works by the artist: Barn with Snow (1934), Purple Hills (1935), and In the Patio I (1946).</description>

Born in Lovell, Maine, Johnson lived mostly in New England, and this painting is likely one of the many works that were inspired by the landscape of Nantucket, Massachusetts.

			Women figured prominently in Johnson’s work, and he frequently painted them alone and often engaged in tasks that were popular activities for women in the late 19th century, such as reading or walking outdoors.</description>

			<description>Asher B. Durand is best known today for his enduring images of the American landscape, especially of the Hudson River Valley, the Catskills, and the Adirondack Mountains in New York. A founding member of the National Academy of Design, he studied engraving before devoting himself to landscape painting and was one of the primary painters of the Hudson River School.

			Durand’s canvases reflect the great passion and unrelenting respect he possessed for the natural environment. In the detailed charcoal study for Landscape-Composition: In the Catskills, which he probably made on site, Durand included the small figural forms in the foreground; in this, the final painting of the subject, these tiny figures, juxtaposed with the immensity of the mountains and the breadth of the land before them, emphasize the awe-inspiring presence of the land itself.

			<description>Francisco de Goya was an artist of remarkable talents, responsible for works ranging from altarpieces to nudes, from brutally realistic images of war to the horrifying and visionary scenes of his print series. The most highly sought portraitist in Madrid, Goya served as the official painter to the Spanish Court.

			The Marqués de Sofraga, among the most powerful of Goya’s portraits, was probably commissioned to celebrate the sitter’s appointment as director of the Royal Academy of History in 1794. The Marqués is shown in his most official attire, but as in the greatest of portraits, Goya mitigates between his own artistic ambitions and the visual propaganda desired by the sitter. The sitter’s medals, for example, would have been immediately recognizable to contemporaries as markers of status, but Goya has painted them in an almost impressionistic technique; the Golden Fleece at Sofraga’s breast is reduced to daubs of paint.

			Likewise, while there can be no question of the sitter’s importance, there is something chilling in the Marqués’s heavy-lidded gaze. Goya’s penetrating view of human psychology – fully evident in this masterpiece – has few equals in the history of portraiture.</description>

			<title>Radha comes to Krishna with her vina, from the Rasikapriya by Keshavdas</title>

			<description>This painting is one of nearly 2,000 works in The San Diego Museum of Art's world-class Edwin Binney 3rd Collection of Indian paintings. A selection from this collection is always on view in the Museum’s galleries.

			Written in Hindi by Keshavdas in 1591, the Rasikapriya classifies heroes and heroines in different stages of maturity or experience and describes their varying reactions to similar situations.  Most of the attention is given to the reactions of heroines, who are cleverly analyzed in circumstances caused by the hero (the blue Krishna every time), as a very aggressive lover, and often a philanderer.  Keshavdas describes 360 circumstances of love. He composed the work to entertain his patron, the Raja of Orchha.

			The episodes usually involve not only the hero and heroine (Krishna and Radha) but her female companions, or sakhis, as well.  They serve as confidantes and messengers for the lovers.  In the upper register Radha is longing for the stand-offish Krishna, and with the advice of the sakhis, boldly takes the initiative, going to him with her vina to please him with music.</description>

			<description>Still-life painting was virtually nonexistent in European art before the 1590s, and Sánchez Cotán is considered not only among the first practitioners of the genre, but also arguably the greatest. This work, moreover, is universally acclaimed as his masterpiece.

			Brilliantly executed, the painting is unflinching in its naturalism and simplicity. The mysterious serenity of the composition, in which the objects are positioned in a perfect curve against the deep black background, has led many to question the meaning or function of the image. For some, the work is an exercise in pure painting, the straightforward depiction of vegetables in a cold cellar. Others, however, believe that the picture may have religious overtones, and that it should be understood as a celebration of God’s most humble creations. In support of the latter reading, it is often noted that Sánchez Cotán gave up his possessions and entered a Carthusian monastery soon after painting this canvas.</description>
